    <h3>Malookhia Stew</h3>
    <p>This dish is a chicken stock based stew made using the malookhia leaf and chicken, but can also be made vegetarian. I do not recommend using beef or lamb for this recipe!
        Best served with rice and top with vinegar soaked onion to add a sharp flavor; this dish will sooth any soul and make make you whole!
