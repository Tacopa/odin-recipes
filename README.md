Before starting:
This project is based on using the HTML knowledge I have gained from the Odin project this far to create a simple HTML based website to organize my recipes.
I will have demonstrated my knowledge of lists and inserting images as well as other things like linking other pages and headings!
It will not be pretty since I have not learned CSS yet, but it will be functional! 
Let's see what I can make!
